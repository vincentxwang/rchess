# rchess

rchess is a Rust-based chess engine that runs in the command line!

Build the executable using `cargo build --release`, and run with `cargo run --release`!

Input 0 to play as White and 1 to play as Black. 5 to 6 should be a functional depth, although I am trying to improve this. Moves are in long notation (e.g 1. e4 is e2e4).
